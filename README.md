## How to play
- A: Jump
- Start: Start game/Pause Game
- Dpad: Move left and right


All 4 players need to press the A button to start playing.
Alternatively you can also start the game with all players that have pressed A by pressing the start button once.

While playing, the player needs to repeatedly tap the A button to stay in the air. 
Failing to press the button will make the player fall.

The player can also move left and right using the D-Pads left and right arrows.

Hitting a pipe results in the death of a player.
